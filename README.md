## About This Repository

This repository contains the **Foundation Projects** for the  
**ZAS Robotics Navigational Robot Car-2 – Communications Edition**, a hands-on learning kit designed to teach wireless control, embedded communication, and real-time robot command processing.

Car-2 is the communication-focused version of the Navigational Robotics Series.  
Instead of autonomous navigation, it uses a **transmitter–receiver architecture** to enable real-time remote control.

### Technologies & Concepts You Will Learn

- Wireless communication using **NRF24L01**
- Joystick-based real-time directional control  
- Gesture-based control using **MPU6050**
- Button-based action triggering  
- Sending & receiving data packets  
- Robotic control architecture  
- Real-time embedded command processing  
- OLED display for mode/action feedback  

### Car-2 Project Outcomes

Students learn how remote-controlled robots work:

- How a controller sends data to a robot  
- How a robot interprets incoming commands  
- How wireless protocols work in embedded systems  
- How to build RC cars, robot arms, and drone-like controllers  
- How to design communication flows between devices  
- How to generate data for **Imitation Learning** or **Reinforcement Learning** projects  

### Who Is This Kit For?

- Schools & STEM education programs  
- Robotics and innovation labs  
- Engineering colleges & polytechnics  
- IoT and embedded learning centers  
- Hobbyists & self-learning students  

### Car-1 + Car-2: A Complete Robotics Learning Journey

- **Car-1 → Sensors + Autonomous Navigation**  
- **Car-2 → Wireless Control + Communication Architecture**

When combined, learners understand both sides of modern robotics:  
**Intelligence + Communication**, similar to drones, AGVs, warehouse robots, and industrial IoT systems.
