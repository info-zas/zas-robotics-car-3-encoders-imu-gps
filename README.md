## About This Robot
The **ZAS Robotics Car-3 (Advanced Autonomy Edition)** is the most powerful robot in the ZAS Navigational Series.  
It is designed for **university engineering labs, robotics research teams, AI/ML learners, and advanced autonomy courses**.

Car-3 brings together a high-precision sensor suite with a stable motion platform, enabling hands-on learning in:

- Autonomous Navigation  
- Sensor Fusion  
- Control Theory  
- Robotics Algorithms  
- Outdoor & Indoor Localization  
- Research Prototyping  

It is ideal for students who want to understand how real autonomous robots — such as AGVs, UAVs, warehouse robots, and research platforms — perform localisation, mapping, and control.

## Key Learning Outcomes
With Car-3, learners can explore and implement:

- **Odometry** using dual wheel encoders  
- **IMU Drift Correction** and orientation estimation  
- **Compass-based heading stabilisation**  
- **GPS-based outdoor navigation** (waypoints & tracking)  
- **Sensor fusion** (Complementary Filter, Kalman Filter, Extended Kalman Filter)  
- **PID control** for speed + heading  
- **Trajectory planning** and path modelling  
- **Reinforcement Learning data collection**  
- **Research experimentation** in dynamics, filtering, and motion modelling  

Car-3 provides both **hardware precision** and **algorithm flexibility**, making it a true research-grade learning tool.
